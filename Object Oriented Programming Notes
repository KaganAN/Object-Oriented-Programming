  #### Objects:
  ---
  - There are two types of objects
  - Objects in general computer science refer to any type of data that exists in the computers memory which has a value and can be called or referenced by an identifier
  - Objects in OOP (object oriented programming) is an instance in a class where an object can be a variable, function, or data structure (or a combination of them)
  #### The OOP Paradigm:
  ---
  - *Object Oriented Programming* creates reusable programmed software systems
  - Creates **objects** to use in said programmed software
  - Uses definitions to interpret code
  
  Procedure-oriented:              OOP:
  - Be logical                     - Name attribute
  - Complete tasks                 - Home address
  - Complete tasks that humans     - Attributes related to humans
    would be able to
  
  - Classes are a collection of all objects which can be accessed from it
  - Classes have attributes
  - Attributes are an objects tools
  - Fields are any variables belonging to an object or class
  - Methods are functions which objects are able to call upon
  
  #### OOP in Python 3:
  ---
  - Class is a python 3 built in keyword which allows the creation of classes
  Example:
  '''Python 3
  class Person:
    pass #Empty
  #end of Person Class
  
  student1 = Person() #student1 now belongs to Person Object
  '''
