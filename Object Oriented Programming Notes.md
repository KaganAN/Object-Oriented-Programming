# Slideshow 1 Notes:

  #### Objects:
  ---
  - There are two types of objects
  - Objects in general computer science refer to any type of data that exists in the computers memory which has a value and can be called or referenced by an identifier
  - Objects in OOP (object oriented programming) is an instance in a class where an object can be a variable, function, or data structure (or a combination of them)
  #### The OOP Paradigm:
  ---
  - *Object Oriented Programming* creates reusable programmed software systems
  - Creates **objects** to use in said programmed software
  - Uses definitions to interpret code
  
  Procedure-oriented:              OOP:
  - Be logical                     - Name attribute
  - Complete tasks                 - Home address
  - Complete tasks that humans     - Attributes related to humans
    would be able to
  
  - Classes are a collection of all objects which can be accessed from it
  - Classes have attributes
  - Attributes are an objects tools
  - Fields are any variables belonging to an object or class
  - Methods are functions which objects are able to call upon
  
  #### OOP in Python 3:
  ---
  - Class is a python 3 built in keyword which allows the creation of classes
  Example:
  '''Python 3
  class Person:
    pass #Empty
  #end of Person Class
  
  student1 = Person() #student1 now belongs to Person Object
  '''
  
  - Methods for classes are declared like a function
  - Initialization method is used as soon as an object of a class is called upon
  - Self parameter declares that the method is applied and used for itself
  - Double underscore overwrites built in python features
          

# Slideshow 2 Notes:
---
  #### Encapsulation: 
  ---
  - Encapsuilation is sued to restrict the access to certain classes and objects attributes/methods
  - This is useful for data protection and restricting what methods can be called upon
  - This is done in python by using double underscores as a prefix
  
  #### Overloading and Overriding:
  ---
  - Overloading is when two methods with the same name exist in one class but possess different parameters
  - Overriding is when two methods with the same name exist **and** have the same parameters
  - **You can't overload in Python 3**
  
  #### Polymorphism
  ---
  - Polymorphism is a method which can be utilized across multiple classes and objects assuming the correct parametrs are met
  
  #### Base Overrides
  --- 
  - Two different classes utilize the same attribute and/or method 
  - A child would override that universal method and utilize it differently
  - Those are the two fundamental concepts related to overriding and polymorphism dual utility in Python
  - This concept can be used to override built-in methods in Python 3
  
  #### __repr__() base function:
  ---
  - This function allows us to control what is returned by the repr() string

  #### Inheritance
  ---
  - When an object/class gets its features from a parent class
      1. Single Inheritance: A child class inherting the features of a single superclass or a parent class
      2. Multiple Inheritance: A child class inherting the features of mulitple parent classes
      3. Multilevel Inheritance: A child class inherting from another child 
  - A child class does not need a new __init__() method unless there is a new attribute 
  - A child class does not need to reinstate the parents methods unless the child class overrides them
  - super() is a method which allows for child classes to refer to their parent class
  - Multiple inheritances have different types
    1. Multi-Generational: Grandparent class --> Parent class --> Child class
    2. Multi-Parent: Parent A + Parent B --> Child class
    3. Mixture of 1 and 2
# Slideshow 4 Notes:
---
  #### Iterable Objects
  ---
  - Objects which can be iterated through similarly to a sequence 
  - __iter__() allows objects to be iterable
  - __next__() grabs the next value while iterating
